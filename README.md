# Tax Deductible Software Projects

## Why?

Every year around May and April I find myself looking for places to donate some money to
help out my tax bracket. Don't lie, you do too. As software professionals or technologists, we have
a significant amount of more disposable income then most people on this planet, and the
best thing we can do is support the projects that we use day in day out. This list is a
consolidated list of places that (at least in the US) you can donate to for tax purposes
to help both the project and your bracket.

## Help?

Got a suggestion? Awesome! PRs accepted. At least for now put a link in like below to the
main site of the project, and then a link to the direct Donate page. (This may change over
time.)
